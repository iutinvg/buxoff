What?
=====
Buxoff is short for Buxfer Offline. And this is yet another client app for the famous 
finacial tracker.

There are three main differences from ther other clients:
# it is offline;
# that's why it is fast;
# it is safe (read below).

Who?
====
This is application for those who is traveling a lot, always on the run. Yes, 3G everywhere nowadays,
but, alas, sometime it is terribly slow or too expesive. Do you like international roaming?

Why?
====
Buxfer is not yet another slow / buggy web app forcing you to wait forages until it loads.
This is native mobile application working as fast as you phone can. You can save all your
expenses on the spot and push them to server later -- when you are in free WiFi zone or 3G is fine.

The transaction properties (tags, transactions, rules) are saved locally on device and autocompletion 
helps you fill the fieds. More you use the app, more rules it knows.

Buxoff uses email interface of buxfer.com, thus it doesn't require your buxfer account credentials 
and even Internet connection. And nobody can see your buxfer account using this app if you happy enough
to lose you mobile. 

It is just to log your expenses. Indeed, why could you need all these
reports when you drink beer in Munich? I think you should leave the analytics for the time when you
have a free evening: just sit near the fireplace, open your laptop, take some cognac (or beer again?), open 
the expenses report and think about all your life. If it is boring - call your wife.
